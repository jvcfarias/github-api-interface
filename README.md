<h1>Hello, recruiter!</h1>
<h2>I'm Joao Victor Farias, a self-taught developer. </h2>
<h4>This is part of a bootcamp that prepares to become a fullstack Dev. With it, I could learn the importance of components and their usage for a collaborative project with teams and for bigger and more ambitious projects, keeping the code readability and reusability.  </h4>
